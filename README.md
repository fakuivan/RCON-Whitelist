# RCON Whitelist (remake) [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/fakuivan/RCON-Whitelist.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/fakuivan/RCON-Whitelist)
A sourcemod plugin that adds a layer of security to the RCON protocol, limiting the the sources from where an RCON connection can be stablished.

This plugin is a remake of the original [RCON Whitelist](https://forums.alliedmods.net/showthread.php?p=2420694), the most significant difference with the original one is that this one exposes natives for other plugins to use, so structuring them in modular manner encouraged.

## Status: 
**Under development**

## "Usable" releases:
While this plugin *is* under development and I probably won't offer backwards compatibility between dev releases, you can still use it if you like the new things that offers.

## Included "modules":
* RCON Whitelist Manager: a module that helps you manage the whitelist database
